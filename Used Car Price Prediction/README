The goal of this project is to build a model for predicting used auto prices. The price
is the target variable. Before building the model more than 200 thousands ads were collected on the car 
trading website. It was done in early August 2021. The competition used 36,000 ads,
which were collected during 2020. 2020 and 2021 are very unusual years due to the pandemic,
which affected the market, including the car market.

To collect data, I used several special libraries for this.
Since I collected a lot of ads, I used threads to speed up the process.
The data was collected not on kaggle.com, but in ide pycharm.

The test data table had the key features (manufacturing year, model, make, model year,
mileage, engine size, engine power, color, number of doors, number of owners, steering wheel side,
body type, fuel type, drivetrain) All the features mensioned above were collected for training data.  
Plus, additional features were collected for training and
test data (acceleration time to 100 miles/h, transmission, types of rear and front brakes, types of rear and
front suspensions. The collected data had some nans, but I filled them in.
