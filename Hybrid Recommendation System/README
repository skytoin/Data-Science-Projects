The goal of this project is to build a recommendation system to predict customer satisfaction with 
specific purchase. The data for training and submission is from Amazon. The data contains
user ids, product ids, product category, cost, number of stars, rank in Amazon system, the year and month
of purchase, number of reviews, the weight of the product, indicatation if purchase was verified or not, the
brand of the product, and the target variable. If buyer is satisfied with specific purchase then the value 
of target variable is 1 and if buyer isn't satisfied the value is 0.
 
The given data had some features with missed values. Missed values wered filled in if feature had low percentage
of missed values. Features like link to images were dropped, because they had too much of missed values.
